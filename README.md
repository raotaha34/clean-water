SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation  
 Clean water is essential for life, health, and dignity. Yet millions of people around the world still lack access to safe drinking water and proper sanitation. Without clean water, communities face preventable diseases, poor hygiene, and limited opportunities for education and economic growth.  Sustainable Development Goal 6 aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Achieving this goal means protecting water sources, improving sanitation systems, and using water responsibly.  Every action matters. Conserving water, reducing pollution, and supporting initiatives that provide clean water can help create a healthier and more sustainable future for everyone.  Clean water is not a luxury. It is a basic human right.  #SDG6 #CleanWater #SanitationForAll #SustainableDevelopment
